# JavaScript.forum

Welcome to the Git repo for the javascript.forum site! 

Whether you're just here to poke around or if you want to collaborate, you are more than welcome!

This README is a living document, so check back for updates!
## Purpose

javascript.forum is a place for all who love JavaScript to come together and discuss our favorite language.


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

The site is mostly written in TypeScript and React, so if you're familiar with those, you'll feel right at home! Even if you are already familiar with forking and pull-requests, you should still read through the [contributions](CONTRIBUTIONS.md) page, as there are important style guides to follow.
